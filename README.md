# BOOK RECOMENDATION SYSTEM
___
We see the use of recommendation systems all around us. These systems are personalizing our web experience, telling us what to buy (Amazon), which movies to watch (Netflix), whom to be friends with (Facebook), which songs to listen (Spotify) etc. These recommendation systems leverage our shopping/ watching/ listening patterns and predict what we could like in future based on our behavior patterns. The most basic models for recommendations systems are **collaborative filtering** models which are based on **assumption that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste**.
